<!-- ## Project objective
This project was built as I was learning about the Express web framework and the Pug templating engine. Through this project I learned about the request and response objects, body-parser, routes, templates, middleware, cookies (cookie-parser) redirects, error handling, modularizing routes, route parameters and query strings, serving static assets with a static server, and much more. :) -->

<!-- ## Techniques and concepts
- Express web framework
- Pug templating engine -->

<!-- ## Code example
```javascript
// Begin interval for tick()
  componentDidMount() {
    console.log('stopwatch mounted')
    this.intervalID = setInterval(() => this.tick(), 100)
  }

  // Do not leak memory if stopwatch is removed from page
  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.intervalID);
  }

  tick = () => {
    console.log('ticking...')
    if (this.state.isRunning) {
      const now = Date.now();
      this.setState( prevState => ({
        previousTime: now,
        elapsedTime: prevState.elapsedTime + (now - this.state.previousTime)
      }));
    }
  }
``` -->
